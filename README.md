# Todo List

This is an enhanced version of the previously developed task management application. A new feature has been introduced, allowing users to keep track of completed tasks. The primary advantage of this task tracker is its responsiveness, ensuring optimal functionality across various devices and screen sizes. Additionally, it leverages localStorage to persist data locally, eliminating the need for a backend infrastructure.


The user interface (UI) of this task tracker has been meticulously crafted using Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable utility-first CSS framework. This approach ensures a polished and visually appealing experience for users. The application's logic and interactivity are powered by React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, in conjunction with Vite, a modern and efficient build tool.

Vite streamlines the development process by providing an optimized development server and a lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) experience. This combination of React and Vite facilitates rapid development and iteration, enabling developers to build and test features promptly.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
